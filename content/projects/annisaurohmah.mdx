Like so many others, I just wanted a place to collect some projects I worked on. I wanted to have a place to showcase my work, share my thoughts, and connect with others. So, I built this website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

I modified the design from [Chronark's Highstorm](https://highstorm.vercel.app/) template. I chose this template because I liked the clean design and the focus on the content. I made some changes to the design and added some new features to make it my own.

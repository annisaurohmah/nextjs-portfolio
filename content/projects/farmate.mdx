## Project Overview
Farmate seeks to foster public attention to understand organic farming and be actively involved in sustainable agriculture in the future for the Development of an Advanced and Sustainable Indonesia through knowledge dissemination.  

In this project, I am responsible for the research the problem. I also design the mobile application, including the user interface and user experience. The design process includes user research, wireframing, prototyping, user testing, and iteration.

## Tools Used
- **Figma**

## Problem Statement
- Lack of easyaccess to comprehensive organic farming information and 
courses
- Difficulty in planning cropping and farming practices complex
- Have an interest in sustainable and environmentally friendly farming, but do not understand its practical implementation in life
- PPL (Penyuluhan Pertanian Lapangan) in the community is still inefficient because there are obstacles in infrastructure, schedule making, and others
- The need for speed, accuracy, and precision of information in the human era demands efficient services to facilitate agricultural learning

## Solution
After going through the design thinking process found a solution in the form of application features:
### Home
- Home is personalized based on the user's interests and habits. There are article and 
plan recommendations, and also shortcuts for courses being studied. 
### Community
- Community is a menu where users can discuss in a forum with other users. 
### AgriInfo
- AgriInfo is a menu that contains articles, videos, and photos related to agriculture, the 
latest news, agricultural technology, and information. that will always be updated
### Course
- Farmate courses have a gamification system. This form of gamification is expected to 
increase user engagement in learning about organic farming.
### AgriPlan
- AgriPlan provides a place for users to plan their farming or cropping cycle and 
provides personalized cropping plan recommendations.

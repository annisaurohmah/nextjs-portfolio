## Project Overview
Zenspire helps the obstacles faced in the face-to-face CBT treatment process. Zenspire also provides development innovations to the shortcomings of existing CBT applications to become more personalized with enhanced Artificial Intelligence technology and support features to motivate users so that they can play a role in increasing the success of therapy. This is in line with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) point 3 on “Good Health and Well-Being” in improving mental health and well-being.
